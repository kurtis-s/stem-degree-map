===============
A small project to produce a chloropleth of the number of math/engineering degrees in each US state, adjusted by population.  The chloropleth is made using d3 and data from the 2012 census.  The map is described in more detail on my [blog](http://kshuler.com/blog/where-do-engineers-live/).
