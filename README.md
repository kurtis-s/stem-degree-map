stem-degree-map
===============
A small project to produce a chloropleth of the number of math/engineering degrees in each US state, adjusted by population. The chloropleth is made using d3 and data from the 2012 census. The map is described in more detail on my [blog](http://kshuler.com/blog/where-do-engineers-live/).

The map can be viewed simply by checking out the repository and opening index.html.  

If you want to reproduce the data and shapefiles, they can be generated by running:

    make clean
    make

The dependencies for reproducing the data are [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/) (more specifically, ogr2ogr), and [topojson](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson).

The queries for the attached census data can be reproduced by using the .aff files in the data directory on [American FactFinder](factfinder2.census.gov/).
