stem-degree-map
===============
A small project to produce a chloropleth of the number of math/engineering degrees in each US state, adjusted by population. The chloropleth is made using d3 and data from the 2012 census. The map is described in more detail on my [blog](http://kshuler.com/blog/where-do-engineers-live/).

The map itself can be viewed simply by checking out the repository and opening index.html.  

If you want to reproduce the data and shapefiles, they can be generated by running:

    make clean
    make

The dependencies for reproducing the data are [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), [python](https://www.python.org/), [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/) (more specifically, ogr2ogr), and [topojson](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson).  The python files are written in python3, so if you donâ€™t want to modify the python files for python2, make sure your PATH is pointing to an appropriate python executable.

The queries for the attached census data can be reproduced by using the .aff files in the data directory on [American FactFinder](factfinder2.census.gov/).
